# main
- **Focus:** UI enhancement using Bootstrap.
- **Description:** This branch builds on top of the `master` branch and applies **Bootstrap 5** styling to the login, logout, and dashboard pages. It's focused on improving the user interface while maintaining the core backend functionalities.

# hotels
- **Focus:** Hotel Management System (CRUD)
- **Description:** This branch implements a full **Hotel CRUD system** on top of the Bootstrap-styled dashboard. Features include:
  - Add, Edit, View, and Delete hotel entries
  - Display hotels using responsive **hotel cards**
  - **Pagination** to manage hotel listings
